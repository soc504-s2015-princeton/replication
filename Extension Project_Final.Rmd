We chose to replicate Andrés Villarreal's 2004 AJS paper, "The Social Ecology of Rural Violence: Land Scarcity, the Organization of Agricultural Production, and the Presence of the State." Applying an ecological theory of crime to the study of rural violence in Mexico, Villarreal attempts explain the fact that rural municipalities have high variation in homicide rates by investigating the effects of land distribution, collective ownership, and the organization of agricultural production on homicide rates. He tests five specific hypotheses: (1) When agricultural land is scarce relative to the number of individuals, there will be more conflict and therefore more homicides; (2) An unequal distribution of land will lead to more violent conflict; (3) When property rights are not well enforced or are contingent, there will be more conflict over lands. For this reason, ejido and communal units will experience more violence; (4) agricultural production systems that involve more commodified relations of production and exchange will be associated with a breakdown of community social cohesion and therefore with more violence, and the introduction of cash crops will lead to greater conflict over resources and control over trade, and consequently to more violence; and (5) remote mountainous areas will have higher rates of violence due to the absence of state institutions.

We were unable to replicate Villarreal's findings, due in part to changes in Mexican data disclosure laws. For our extension of Villarreal's paper, we decided to update his analysis with newer (2007) data -- his original analysis was conducted using 1991 data. In doing so, we decided to remove the variables for which we identified data issues (The Thiel Index, Percent of Plots 5 Hectares or Less, and Log of Average Plot Size), as well as one variable for which 2007 data is not available (Percent Subsistence Agriculture). We correspondingly decided to include several new variables in the analysis, including a different indicator of land inequality to replace the Thiel index (the Gini Index), a new indicator of state presence not used by Villarreal (Number of Policemen per 1,000 people) and a new control variable -- the Human Development Index (HDI). We hope that these changes and additions will produce a valid analysis that we can compare to Villrreal's findings.

**Adding Updated Agricultural Variables**
*Note: The great HADLEY WICKHAM has noted that there is a glitch in the read_excel() command such that it produces ugly output in the console when we run it. This output currently cannot be hidden in R Markdown. However, this function is much more efficient than the previous xlsx package, so we have used it here. We will do more troubleshooting on this in the coming days.*

**Conclusions**
Our extension shows that (as expected) poverty, inequality, the percentage of young men in a municipality, and the percentage of female-headed households in a municipality are related to the municipality's homicide rate. The municipality's degree of collective ownership is also related to its homicide rate. However, with 2007-10 data, Villarreal's main conclusion that state presence (measured by altitude and an additional variable, police per 1,000 people) no longer holds. The coefficient for weighted SD of elevation is barely significant, with an SE half its size.
