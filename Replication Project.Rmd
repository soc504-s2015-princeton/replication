We chose to replicate Andrés Villarreal's 2004 AJS paper, "The Social Ecology of Rural Violence: Land Scarcity, the Organization of Agricultural Production, and the Presence of the State." Applying an ecological theory of crime to the study of rural violence in Mexico, Villarreal attempts explain the fact that rural municipalities have high variation in homicide rates by investigating the effects of land distribution, collective ownership, and the organization of agricultural production on homicide rates. He tests five specific hypotheses: (1) When agricultural land is scarce relative to the number of individuals, there will be more conflict and therefore more homicides; (2) An unequal distribution of land will lead to more violent conflict; (3) When property rights are not well enforced or are contingent, there will be more conflict over lands. For this reason, ejido and communal units will experience more violence; (4) agricultural production systems that involve more commodified relations of production and exchange will be associated with a breakdown of community social cohesion and therefore with more violence, and the introduction of cash crops will lead to greater conflict over resources and control over trade, and consequently to more violence; and (5) remote mountainous areas will have higher rates of violence due to the absence of state institutions.

The 5 hypotheses were tested using negative binomial regressions. Higher land scarcity and agricultural units organized by group were not found to be associated with higher homicide rates, but unequal distribution of land and high percentages of communal and ejido land were associated with higher homicide rates, as were higher rates of coffee and cattle production. Finally, remote mountainous municipalities that were isolated from state institutions had higher homicide rates.

**Preparing the Dataset for Analysis:**

"The hypotheses [...] are tested using a sample of rural municipalities [counties] in Mexico. [...] The sample of rural municipalities is constructed by selecting all municipalities in which more than 75% of the population lives in towns of less than 2,500 residents. [...] Municipalities belonging to the state of Oaxaca were grouped into 30 districts commonly used for statistical purposes. [...] A total of 697 municipalities (37% of all municipalities in the country) satisfy this criterion and are therefore included in the sample (minus some eliminated due to missing values). [...] The number of homicides are obtained from vital statistics compiled by the Mexican government. [...] In order to smooth out yearly fluctuations, the total number of homicides over a three-year period (1990– 92) is used, and the population at risk is assumed to be three times the municipal population." [...] The variables for land scarcity, collective ownership, and the organization of agricultural production are all drawn from the 1991 Agricultural and Livestock Census [...] 

I measure the scarcity of land for the sample of rural municipalities (hypothesis 1) in three different ways: the percentage of rural production units of five hectares of land or less, the log of the average plot size, and the log of persons per hectare of agricultural land. [...] Because the extent to which small plots of land satisfy the needs of residents will depend on the quality of the land, I introduce the log of maize yields (expressed as tons per hectare) along with each indicator of land scarcity in the regression models. [...] 

The degree of land inequality (hypothesis 2) is measured by adapting an indicator commonly used for income inequality known as Theil’s index. [...] The index of land inequality is given by: T = 1/u_tot * (summation from i=1 to G) *(u_i)z_iln(z_i), where z_i = (s_i/u_i)/(s_tot/u_tot) is the ratio of the average plot size for agricultural units in plot size category i (their entire surface area s_i over the number of units u_tot) and G is the number of plot size categories. [..] The eight plot size categories are less than 2 hectares; 2–5 hectares; 5–20 hectares; 20–50 hectares; 50–100 hectares; 100–1,000 hectares; 1,000–2,500 hectares; and more than 2,500 hectares. 

In order to test the third hypothesis regarding the effect of contingent or not well-enforced property rights (hypothesis 3), I enter the percentage of the rural surface area in each municipality constituted by ejidos and communal units according to the Agricultural and Livestock Census into the regression models. [...]

I measure the impact of the relations of agricultural production (hypothesis 4) using two different indicators. First, I enter the percentage of subsistence agricultural units, defined as those producing only for internal consumption within the household and not for sale in the market. [...] The second measure I use to test the impact of the relations of production is the percentage of agricultural units with individual (as opposed to group) organization of production. [...] Finally, I test the effect of cash crop production on homicidal violence using the percentage of units dedicated to harvesting coffee and raising cattle.

Six control variables are introduced in the regression models [...] First, I introduce the log of the population density as a measure of the degree of public social interaction. [...] The percentage of the population constituted by young males ages 15–29 is included as a measure of the age structure of the population. [...] The ethnic composition of a municipality is accounted for by using the percentage of residents five years of age or older who speak an indigenous language. [...] The illiteracy rate is used as an indicator of resource deprivation. [...] The percentage of female-headed households was also found to be an important predictor of homicide rates
in previous work and is therefore included in the regressions below.[...] A dummy variable is also introduced in the regression models to control for the municipalities located in the state of Mexico. Although some of these municipalities are technically rural, they are located in the Valley of Mexico in close proximity to Mexico City and tend to have higher homicide rates compared to the rest of the country, even when accounting for basic structural factors. 

Finally, as described above, a measure of the local topography is used to test the effect of access to state institutions on the rate of homicidal violence [the standard deviation of elevation in a municipality]. However, remote rural areas are not only farther from the reach
of state institutions, they are also farther from medical services. [...] I therefore introduce the number of medical doctors in the municipality per 10,000 residents according to the 1990 census as a predictor of homicide rates in all the regression models.""

*Variables were added to the dataset for analysis in order of the file they came from - i.e. all variables from the standard census dataset first, then variables regarding doctors, female-headed households, and percent young males (which each require special sub-datasets from the census), then elevation data, then population density (which requires map data about the area of municipalities), then homicides. The dummy variable was added last. Data regarding the state of Oaxaca were separated out through this process, as this state counts municipalities differently - each town is counted as its own municipality, which would skew the data. As noted above, Oaxacan municipalities are typically grouped into 30 districts for analysis--we completed this operation after creating the main analytical dataframe, recalculated all variables for the Oaxacan districts, and merged the two dataframes by municipality code. Variables drawn from the Agricultural Census were added next, as they required matching by name instead of municipality code due to the format of the raw data. Again, data from Oaxaca were separated, recalculated and then recombined with the main dataframe.*
