We'd like to thank Jessa, Gozde, Angela, and Matt for their feedback on our replication and extension projects. 
Your notes were helpful in identifying where our code was unclear, and in making sure all of our functions were well-specified.
We have made almost of the changes you suggested, including adding additional explanations to functions and large code chunks, 
and splitting up such large chunks into multiple lines to improve readability. We are investigating the suggestion that we need
to specify an offset in the negative binomial regressions due to the use of rates instead of counts. The only suggestion we 
did not act upon was Gozde's comment about data imputations - this is a great suggestion, we just don't have time to act on it 
before the project is due! 

Thanks again!

Andr√©s and Leah
